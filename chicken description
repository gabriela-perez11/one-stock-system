Here, we can see a Forrester diagram representation of a simple systems dynamic model of the lifespan of chickens. On the left, we we can see the source or stock of chickens represented by a cloud. Next, is the flow of life (of chickens) between the state variables (boxes: eggs & chickens) and are indicated by arrows with their direction of flow in the model shown by arrows. There are flow valves in this model during the laying, hatching, and expiring stages of chicken life cycle. Information channels affect the future behavior of the model - and in this case information affects hatching and laying of eggs. The laying is directly affected by the grown chickens, and the hatching is directly affected by the eggs. The road crossings are affected by the chickens, and the expiring is affected by the road crossings. Further, this model also includes a casual loop - he letters B and R represent two kinds of loops:Â balancing and reinforcing causal loops. A balancing loop naturally evens itself out and remains stable. A reinforcing loop will increase or decrease exponentially over time. In this model, the time from eggs to hatching is a reinforcing loop, and road crossings are a balancing loop. At the end of this model, on the far right side the model ends in another source or stock (represented as a cloud)
